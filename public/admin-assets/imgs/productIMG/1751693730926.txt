Summary: 
--------------Today’s coordinator session was very interesting and enjoyable. We revised important grammar topics like  verbs, nouns, and pronouns through exercises that were originally taught by Akhil Sir. Even though he didn’t conduct the session, his lessons helped us understand the activities better. It was a beautiful and productive session that helped refresh our grammar knowledge.
